abstract: We provide guarantees for approximate Gaussian process regression resulting from two common low-rank kernel approximations based on random Fourier features and truncating the kernel's Mercer expansion. In particular, we bound the Kullback-Leibler divergence between an exact Gaussian process and one resulting from one of the afore-described low-rank approximations to its kernel, as well as between their corresponding predictive densities. We provide experiments on both simulated data and standard benchmarks showing the effectiveness of our theoretical bounds.
